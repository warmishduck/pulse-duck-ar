// The object scanner (`/?scan`), all in one camera session:
//  1. searching: the camera looks for any exhibit object registered as an image target;
//  2. found: the object glows, and the visitor is asked to point the camera at the floor;
//  3. placed: once they do, that exhibit's creatures appear on the floor where they look, short
//     of the object's wall, facing them (see floor-spot.js), and the regular exhibit view
//     (threejs-scene-init.js) takes over. Two things are measured from the engine's tracked
//     world points first, because what the engine reports is only an assumption: how far the
//     object's wall is (an image target's own distance came out several times too far) and how
//     high the floor is (y = 0 is only where the engine puts it).
// Add `debug` to the address (/?scan&debug) for a live readout of all this on the phone.
//
// `/?scan&marker` is the marker flow: the exhibit's object still names the exhibit and gives the
// wall, but the content stands on a marker printed and laid on the floor (FLOOR_MARKER) and is
// re-anchored to it whenever the marker is seen again, which keeps it from drifting. An invisible
// plane on the real wall hides what is behind it, and the creature starts behind the wall and
// walks out through it (see marker-anchor.js).
//
// `/?scan&c=<code>` of an exhibit with an `mlTarget` is the ML flow: after the poster, a classifier
// (ml/object-detector.js) looks inside a stencil (stencil.js) the visitor fits the free-standing
// object into; once it sees it there, the object stands where the stencil's bottom edge meets the
// floor, and the creature walks out from behind it and round it (object-path.js). Tapping where the
// object stands is the fallback. Sizes are in metres, turned into scene units by the poster's width.

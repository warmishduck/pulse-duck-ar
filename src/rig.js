// loose fit whenever that matrix is rotated. The glowcap's skinned mesh node carries a
// leftover Blender rotation and mirror, so its default box came out ~45% too tall and
// twice too wide: the model was scaled far too small and hovered above its shadow. The
// idle clips only change their model's height by a few %, so their first frame is fine.

// the run cycle drifts. On screen the character would slide off its spot and snap back
// when the clip ends. Pin the root's horizontal position to where the idle clip starts and
// keep its vertical motion: that IS the jump, the crouch and the bend.

// `pinVerticallyIn` lists clips whose vertical root motion should go too, pinned to the
// idle's height. Use it when code moves the character (the level diorama: physics decides
// how high it is, so the clip must not add its own leap on top).

// Y-up space.

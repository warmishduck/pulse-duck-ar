// Define an 8th Wall XR Camera Pipeline Module that puts one exhibit's content into a threejs
// scene on startup (which exhibit comes from the page's address, see route.js and
// content/exhibits.js). An exhibit has creatures, a mini-game, or both, and this has two modes:
//  - creatures: tapping a creature makes it react, each in its own way (see showcase.js);
//  - level: a small diorama of a level from the game, which you play with on-screen buttons
//    (see level.js). It is a button away, or the only thing there when the exhibit has no
//    creatures.
